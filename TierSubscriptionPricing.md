# OrderPrep - Tier Subscription Pricing

**Last Updated:** December 2, 2025  
**Status:** Draft - Pending Customer Validation  
**Based On:** Customer Interview Findings + Flash Sale Discovery

## 📊 Pricing Philosophy

**Core Principle:** Price based on VALUE delivered, not features built.

Different sellers have different problems:
- **Beginners** need basic organization
- **Serious sellers** need revenue protection (payment tracking, flash sale reduction)
- **Business owners** need operational efficiency (team management, analytics)

**Our pricing reflects the money we SAVE them, not the cost to build.**
